  <!--begin answer-->
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</p>
      <p>Zorg Empire welcomes you. Zorg Empire provides its service to you subject to the following Terms of Service (&quot;TOS&quot;), which may be  updated by us from time to time without notice to you. You can review  the most current version of the TOS at any time at: <a href="http://www.zorgempire.com/tos.php">http://www.zorgempire.com/tos.php</a> . In addition, when using particular Zorg Empire owned or operated services,  you and Zorg Empire shall be subject to any posted guidelines or rules  applicable to such services, which may be posted from time to time. All  such guidelines or rules (including but not limited to our Spam Policy)  are hereby incorporated by reference into the TOS. 
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</p>
      <p>Zorg Empire provides users with access to a rich collection of resources,  including various communications tools, forums, search services, personalized content and branded programming through its network of properties which may be accessed through any various  medium or device now known or hereafter developed (the &quot;Service&quot;). You  also understand and agree that the Service may include advertisements  and that these advertisements are necessary for Zorg Empire to provide the Service. You also understand and agree that the Service may include certain communications from Zorg Empire, such as service announcements,  administrative messages and the Zorg Empire Newsletter, and that these communications are considered part of Zorg Empire membership and you will  not be able to opt out of receiving them. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, any new features that augment or enhance the current Service, including the release of new Zorg Empire properties, shall be  subject to the TOS. You understand and agree that the Service is  provided &quot;AS-IS&quot; and that Zorg Empire assumes no responsibility for the timeliness, deletion, mis-delivery or failure to store any user communications or personalization settings. You are responsible for  obtaining access to the Service, and that access may involve  third-party fees (such as Internet service provider or airtime  charges). You are responsible for those fees, including those fees associated with the display or delivery of advertisements. In addition, you must provide and are responsible for all equipment necessary to  access the Service.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Zorg Empire PRIVACY POLICY</p>
      <p>Zorg Empire collects minimum data and information from you. Such can be your ip adress and your hostname. To ensure we are publishing content customers need and want, Zorg Empire collects aggregated site-visitation statistics using cookies. We do not track individuals' use of the site.

When someone visits the site, a cookie is placed on the customer's machine (if the customer accepts cookies) or is read if the customer has visited the site previously.

If you choose to not have your browser accept cookies from the Zorg Empire.com Web site, you will be able to view the text on the screens, however you will not experience a personalized visit nor will you be able to subscribe to the service offerings on the site.</p>
    </li>
     <li>
      <p>USAGE FEES</p>
      <p>
	Unless otherwise stated, the use of service offered is free of charge.
	The user may, however, purchase individual service offerings and individual features offered in the context of Zorg Empire. The user is informed separately on the kind of features for purchase, especially what function each feature has, possibly of the duration of availability of the feature for purchase, the purchase price and the available payment method in connection with the  game.</p>
	<p>Where a minor wishes to buy features for purchase, he assures that he/she received the funds to buy the features for purchase from his/her legal guardian for this purpose or for unrestricted use.
	The agreed-upon charges are due for payment with the conclusion of the contract. The debit payment is made typically through the respective authorized service provider, whereby the withdrawal can be made a few days in advance to guarantee continuous usability. In individual cases, general terms and conditions included by the authorized service provider may be applicable.</p>
	<p>The user assures that all information provided in the context of a payment transaction (including bank, credit card number, etc.) is complete and correct.</p>
	<p>The payment options vary according to the  participant country and the market availability of technically feasible payment options. Zorg Empire reserves the right to amend its payment options.</p>
	<p>Zorg Empire reserves the right to change the fees of the in-game features (including virtual currencies). This includes Zorg Empire`s right to increase or decrease fees for all singular in-game features for all future transactions.</p>
	<p>In case of default, statutory interest accrues. Zorg Empire is also entitled to block the user account, to recover damages and to terminate services.</p>
	<p>Should Zorg Empire through a fault of the user (including an inadequate account balance) incur back charges or cancellation fees, the user shall bear the related costs. Zorg Empire is allowed to request these costs and the accrued charges. If payment is made by credit card, back charges are incurred up to 50 EUR per credit card transaction plus bank charges incurred by Zorg Empire. Zorg Empire is entitled to charge further compensation.</p></li>
       <li>DATA Policies
	<p>A. Details  regarding data controller<br>
	  We want to  live up to your trust. You can contact us for any questions, suggestions or  complaints you may have regarding the way we handle your data in general, or  with regards to this Privacy Policy in particular.</p>
	<p><br>
	  A.1 Data  controller<br>
	  The data  controller responsible for processing personal data is Evdaimon Games. We can  be contacted for general enquiries regarding data protection at the address  provided, by email at webmaster@evdaimon.com or through our ticket support  systemÂ  at https://www.evdaimon.com/?a=ct</p>
    <p>B. General  information regarding data we process and how we collect it</p>
    <p><br>
      In this  section we inform you how we collect your data.<br>
      B.1 Legal  basis for processing data<br>
      We ensure  from the moment of collecting your data that this is done in a reliable, transparent  and appropriate manner. In judging whether we have the right to collect data,  and how this data is to be processed, we orientate ourselves on the  requirements of applicable law, in particular on the provisions of the EU  General Data Protection Regulation (&lsquo;GDPR&rsquo;), the Data Protection Act of the  Hellenic Republic and other legal provisions relating to the handling of  personal data.</p>
    <p><br>
      B.2 Data  automatically collected by us<br>
      When using  Zorg Empire services, system and user-related data is collected automatically  and without any further action on the part of the user. For example, when you  visit Zorg Empire web page, the general specifications of your internet  browser (e.g. type and version), time of access and the related IP address (an  individual address associated with your internet connection at this time), as  well as system configuration details (e.g. screen resolution and operating  system version) are collected and recorded in server logs. As a rule, this  information is not used to identify a specific internet user.</p>
    <p>In the same  way, when you log into a Zorg Empire account (e.g. when logging into a user  account for our forums, support or one of our online games), corresponding data  may be collected automatically. You can find more information about this in  sections below.<br>
      This data  is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the business legitimate interests  (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of Zorg Empire services, their optimization, and for the registration, performance or  termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).</p>
    <p><br>
      B.3 Data  generated by us<br>
      In the  process of registering a Zorg Empire account, and during its subsequent use,  we generate data at different times and for different reasons.<br>
      This  includes an individual username. This identification (e.g. account or character  IDs) serves the purpose of pseudonymization and is required for technical  reasons, for example for logging into and using a user account or for saving  information concerning payment transactions separately. With regards to the  data generated by us, this also includes data which may be recorded by our  support team or community management for the purposes of carrying out their  tasks. Where there is suspicion that there has been a violation of our rules of  the game and Standard Terms of Use, this may include checking and documenting  the facts of the case and, if necessary, issuing warnings, but potentially also  comments in favor of the user concerned, such as special authorizations  permitted in individual cases by the respective rules of the game.</p>
    <p>This data  is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company&rsquo;s legitimate  interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of  Zorg Empire services, their optimization, and for the registration,  performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article  6(1)(b)).</p>
    <p><br>
      B.4 Data  provided by you<br>
      The  majority of the personal data we process is provided directly by our users.  Basic information is collected when registering a Zorg Empire account  (generally your email address and chosen pseudonym to identify your user  account, your game characters and other game elements). As a rule, we do not  collect any specific data such as the user&rsquo;s name, date of birth or address. <br>
      The data  provided by users also includes the content they have written (for example,  texts written in a forum or within the game or other messages sent to us by a  user).<br>
      Generally,  the basic versions of online games offered by us can be used free of charge.  However, the user has the option to purchase additional content. For such  transactions, users therefore provide us with information that is required by  us or our payment service providers in order to complete the payment.<br>
      This data  is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the company&rsquo;s legitimate  interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of  Zorg Empire services, their optimisation, and for the registration,  performance or termination of a user agreement (GDPR Article 6(1)(b)).</p>
    <p><br>
      B.5 Data we  collect from external sources<br>
      In some  cases we receive personal data from third parties. This is primarily the case  when using a third-party login (for example, when logging into Zorg Empire  services via a Facebook or Google account). The data thus obtained shall be  limited to what is necessary for the login in question. However, the respective  third-party provider is responsible for the scope of the transmitted data. We  therefore recommend that you read the data protection regulations of the  third-party provider carefully before using a corresponding login option.</p>
    <p>This data  is processed for the purposes of safeguarding the business&rsquo;s legitimate  interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to ensure the secure and smooth operation of  Zorg Empire services, their optimization, and for the registration,  performance or termination of the user agreement with you (GDPR Article  6(1)(b)).</p>
    <p><br>
      B.6  Voluntary provision and processing<br>
      The  provision of personal data and the associated use of Zorg Empire services are  entirely voluntary. The use of Zorg Empire services, however, may require the  provision and processing of certain data for technical or contractual reasons.  For the registration of a user account, for example, the provision of a valid  email address is essential and in order to complete a payment transaction, the  necessary information must be provided.</p>
    <p>For this  reason, failure to provide the necessary data may mean that we are unable to  provide certain services. Equally certain rights may be exercised in individual  cases which mean that we are unable to provide our services to the  contractually agreed extent. Should this occur, we will inform the person in  question of the consequences in each individual case.</p>
    <p>C. Special  details regarding scope and purpose<br>
      In this  section we explain comprehensively in which specific cases we process your  data.<br>
      The data is  processed directly by Zorg Empire within the territory of the Hellenic  Republic. Should in individual cases personal data be processed by a different  body, such as a company associated with us or a service provider, potentially  in a third country (outside of the European Union or the European Economic  Area), this will always proceed within the legal framework and on the basis of  a contract with the respective third party which stipulates compliance with all  relevant data protection regulations.</p>
    <p>C.1  Advertising on third-party sites and links to our website<br>
      Like many  other companies, we advertise our services on external websites. A typical  example are banner adverts, which are displayed on third-party websites as a  graphic advertising one of the online games we offer and linking to the  corresponding Zorg Empire web page via a hyperlink. Our partners do not  provide such advertisements free of charge. The success of the advertising  campaign is decisive in calculating the partner&rsquo;s remuneration. In order to  determine this, an ID is generated when a user clicks on the advertisement.  This ID is then allocated to the user&rsquo;s account when they subsequently register  for a Zorg Empire account. This enables us to determine the number of new  users we have gained through the campaign in question. Finally, the advertising  partner receives a complete overview of these registrations from us and issues  us an invoice based on these. In some cases, partners also receive remuneration  in the event that a customer completes a payment transaction. However, we do  not pass on personal information about individual users to our advertising  partners.</p>
    <p>When  surfing external websites, the site operator may also set cookies (see C.6) or  create a device ID or a fingerprint (an individual value calculated from the  sum of different characteristics of a user&rsquo;s system) that enable the respective  provider to track the surfing behavior of its visitors. We therefore recommend  that you always read the data protection provisions of a page you visit  carefully.</p>
    <p>Zorg Empire has no interest in tracking the external surfing behavior of its users.  However, we have a legitimate interest in finding out from which websites or  through which advertising campaigns our customers have found their way to us  and which areas of Zorg Empire&rsquo;s services are of particular interest to users  (see sections below).</p>
    <p>This data  is processed for the purposes of safeguarding our legitimate interests (GDPR  Article 6(1)(f)) in promoting Zorg Empire services and the evaluation and  billing of our advertising campaigns.</p>
    <p><br>
      C.2  Visiting our web pages without registering<br>
      To the  greatest possible extent, the Zorg Empire web pages can be visited  anonymously to gain information about our online games. Registering on the  website is only necessary if you wish to use functions that require a Zorg Empire account. For example, participation in our games or forums is only  possible once you register and log into your new Zorg Empire account.  Irrespective of this, personal data may be collected and processed by us  without registration in the following instances.</p>
    <p><br>
      C.2.1  Server logs<br>
      In using  Zorg Empire services, server logs may be created which log certain connection  and usage activities.</p>
    <p>For  example, page views, times of access, the registration of a user account and  the IP address allocated to your internet connection are recorded for the  purposes of identifying and preventing cyberattacks or attempted manipulation,  as well as for statistical analysis and the improvement of Zorg Empire  services. Where necessary, other technical details such as the MAC address (the  network address of your network adapter) or similar identifying features may be  recorded.</p>
    <p>This data  is processed in pursuit of our legitimate interests (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) to  ensure the smooth and secure operation of the Zorg Empire services as well as  their optimization.</p>
    <p>D.Right to erasure<br>
      You have the basic right to demand the immediate deletion of your data. Legal reasons may however stand in the way of this, in particular the requirement to process the relevant data to fulfil the agreement with you or legal data retention requirements. In individual cases your data may also be required for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims. In such instances we will process the affected data strictly in accordance with this purpose, followed by immediate deletion as soon as the relevant reasons for retention no longer apply. We will inform you in such instances accordingly.<br>
      <br>
      E. Right to restriction of processing<br>
As an alternative to the deletion of your data, you have the basic right to demand restrictions in how we process your data. If you make use of this right, we are essentially restricted to storing the associated data. Processing the data in other ways is only permissible with your consent, or for the purposes of establishing, exercising or defending legal claims, or to protect the rights of other natural persons or legal entities. </p>
      </li>

     <li>
      <p>SPECIAL ADMONITIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL USE</p>
      <p>Recognizing the global nature of the Internet, you agree to comply  with all local rules regarding online conduct and acceptable Content.  Specifically, you agree to comply with all applicable laws regarding  the transmission of technical data exported from the country in which you reside.</p>
